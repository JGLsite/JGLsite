- **Payments**: Stripe
- **Deployment**: Netlify
- **Icons**: Lucide React

## 📋 Prerequisites

Before setting up the project, you'll need:

1. **Supabase Account** (Free tier available)
   - Create account at [supabase.com](https://supabase.com)
   - Create a new project
   - Get your project URL and anon key

2. **Stripe Account** (Pay-per-transaction)
   - Create account at [stripe.com](https://stripe.com)
   - Get your API keys from the dashboard

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Clone and Install
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd jgl-management-system
npm install
```

### 2. Environment Setup
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit `.env` with your Supabase credentials:
```env
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key-here
SUPABASE_DB_URL=postgresql://username:password@db.supabase.co:5432/postgres
```

### 3. Database Setup

1. **Connect to Supabase** by setting `VITE_SUPABASE_URL`, `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`, and `SUPABASE_DB_URL` in your `.env` file. The `SUPABASE_DB_URL` value should be the service role connection string from the Supabase dashboard.
2. **Reset & Run Migrations** using the provided script:
   ```bash
   npm run reset-supabase
   ```
   This command drops the existing `public` schema and re-applies all SQL files in `supabase/migrations`.
3. **Seed Demo Data** *(optional)*: Populate initial gyms, events, and challenges after the migrations are applied.

### 4. Start Development
```bash
npm run dev
```

Visit `http://localhost:5173` to see the application.

### Debugging Supabase Connection

When running the app in development mode, the browser console logs whether your
`VITE_SUPABASE_URL` and `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` variables were detected. If
they are missing, the application falls back to demo data.

Additional `[auth]` and `[supabase]` messages now show the steps taken when the
application checks the current session and loads the user profile. Watch the
console to confirm that your credentials load correctly and the Supabase client
initializes without errors.

Every request to Supabase is logged in development mode, showing the HTTP
method, URL, response status, and how long the request took. Errors are printed
to the console to help diagnose network or permission issues.
